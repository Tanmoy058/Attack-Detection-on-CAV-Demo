This repository contains the demo video and corresponding powerpoint slide for the project 
**Data-driven Cyber-Attack Control in Communication between Autonomous Vehicles and Infrastructure for 5G-assisted Transportation Cyber Physical Systems**
Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) is envisioned as a distributed system composed of devices in vehicles, road side units (RSUs), traffic lights, sensors, and etc., and personal devices. 5G networks will help realize such a connected world and become the backbone to enable TCPS. The biggest threat facing autonomous vehicles in TCPS is cybersecurity. In this project, we detect the adversarial attack launched on the signals collected on the TCPS scenario.
